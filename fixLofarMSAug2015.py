# Script to add missing tables in the MS to conform with CASA standards and 
# to make a fix in the MeasInfo in the spectral window table.
#
# Explanation by Jan David Mol:
# 
# The LOFAR Measurement Set is written in a manner inconsistent with the 
# MS definition v2.
# Two additional tables (STATE,PROCESSOR) need to be added because since 
# release a check is done by CASA causing a failure.
#
# Explanation by Ger van Diepen:
# 
# The TableMesRefDesc problem is caused by a change in the coordinates 
# by NRAO some time ago; a type Undefined has been added.
# Basically it means that an MS produced with a newer casacore 
# is not readable by old CASA. I must confess I'm not exactly sure 
# in which casacore release it was introduced. 
# Later I've changed casacore such that it did not stumble anymore on 
# this issue, so the upcoming CASA release should be fine. 
# The CASA group had never merged back my change into their (old) casacore 
# repository used for the previous CASA release.
